PebbleHourGlass
===============

This is an Hour Glass watch-face for the Pebble watch. It's a simple watch design that shows your day, emptying one grain of sand at a time.

The watch-face uses the two halves of the hour glass to tell time. In the top half of the glass, you can see the time remaining hours until midnight, where each sand grain corresponds to one hour. The lower half of the glass fills with sand, with each grain representing a minute past the current hour.

Version 1.0
===============
- First commit, the watch-face is in decent working order.
- There are minor off-by-one row errors in the sand animation.
